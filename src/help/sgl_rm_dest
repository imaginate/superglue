  Values:
    DEST   Must be a valid path. Can include defined VAR KEYs identified by a
           leading `$' and optionally wrapped with curly brackets, `${KEY}'.
    REGEX  Can be any string. Refer to bash test `=~' operator for more details.
    SRC    Must be a valid file path. The SRC file must contain at least one
           `dest' TAG unless `--empty' is used and can contain one `mode' and
           `own' TAG. Note that OPTION values take priority over TAG values.
    TAG    A TAG is defined within a SRC file's contents. It must be a one-line
           comment formatted as `# @TAG VALUE'. Spacing is optional except
           between TAG and VALUE. The TAG must be one of the options below.
      `dest'  Formatted `# @dest DEST'.
      `mode'  Formatted `# @mode MODE'.
      `own'   Formatted `# @own OWNER'.
    VAR    Must be a valid `KEY=VALUE' pair. The KEY must start with a character
           matching `[a-zA-Z_]', can only contain `[a-zA-Z0-9_]', and must end
           with `[a-zA-Z0-9]'. The VALUE must not contain a `,'.
