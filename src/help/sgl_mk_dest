  Values:
    ATTR   Must be a file attribute from below options.
      `mode'
      `ownership'
      `timestamps'
      `context'
      `links'
      `xattr'
      `all'
    ATTRS  Must be a list of one or more ATTR separated by `,'.
    CTRL   Must be a backup control method from below options.
      `none|off'      Never make backups (even if `--backup' is given).
      `numbered|t'    Make numbered backups.
      `existing|nil'  If numbered backups exist make numbered. Otherwise make simple.
      `simple|never'  Always make simple backups.
    DEST   Must be a valid path. Can include defined VAR KEYs identified by a
           leading `$' and optionally wrapped with curly brackets, `${KEY}'.
    EXT    Must be a valid file extension to append to the end of a backup file.
           The default is `~'. Spaces are not allowed.
    MODE   Must be a valid file mode.
    OWNER  Must be a valid USER[:GROUP].
    REGEX  Can be any string. Refer to bash test `=~' operator for more details.
    SRC    Must be a valid file or directory path. If SRC is a directory each
           child file path is processed as a SRC. Each SRC file must contain at
           least one `dest' TAG (unless `--empty' is used), can contain one
           `mode', `owner', and `version' TAG, and can contain multiple `include'
           or `var' TAG. Note that OPTION values take priority over TAG values.
    TAG    A TAG is defined within a SRC file's contents. It must be a one-line
           comment formatted as `# @TAG VALUE'. Spacing is optional except
           between TAG and VALUE. The TAG must be one of the options below.
      `dest'     Formatted `# @dest DEST'.
      `include'  Formatted `# @include FILE'.
      `mode'     Formatted `# @mode MODE'.
      `owner'    Formatted `# @owner OWNER'.
      `var'      Formatted `# @var KEY=VALUE'.
      `version'  Formatted `# @version VERSION'.
    VAR    Must be a valid `KEY=VALUE' pair. The KEY must start with a character
           matching `[a-zA-Z_]', only contain characters `[a-zA-Z0-9_]', and end
           with a character matching `[a-zA-Z0-9]'.
    VARS   Must be a list of one or more VAR separated by `,'.

  Returns:
    0  PASS
